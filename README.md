# Snow-Presence-Trends
# This is the draft for the Github version without testing. A fully tested version of the model will come out soon.
# The `R` directory included three .R files
# 1. core_function: The model function `Binary_Markov_TS(obs)` is used to fit the binary time series with the proposed model. It could be applied to a new time series dataset.
# 2. Check_Result: Please load the dataframe `./data/Github_DF` and `./data/snow` before call any functions in this files. These functions help to reproduce most of the plots given in the paper.
# 3. Example: load the result obtained in our model. The function `main` provides the details to obtain our final result, don't call this function unless you need to verify our result. (It takes hours to call, depend on CPU).
